# Olympus Network

A simple playground for software infrastructure tools and virtual machines. In this setup, the host machine will be the central device, networking with 3 virtual machines. Currently, this project is being developed on Linux, but should work on MacOS. Eventually, I plan to implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for VM setup.

## Requirements

The following must be installed on the host machine:

* [Python 3.8](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or greater
* [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)  

Everything else should be installed through the `Makefile` in a local scope only. The use of `Direnv` allows for ease of access by allowing us to load and unload environment variables depending on the current directory.

## Starting Up

In order to start up the Olympus Network machines, you can use the following command.

```bash
# Start the Vagrant machines
make startup
```

If you want to use Ansible, we can configure a virtual environment to isolate the installation to local scope.

```bash
# Set up a Python3 virtual env, name it ".venv" for compatibility with the Makefile
python -m venv .venv

# Install Python prerequisites using local pip
make install-requirements
```

You should now have 3 Linux VMs running.

## Connect to VMs via SSH

To remote connect into any of the virtual machines, we can use Vagrant's built-in ssh command. This allows us to connect via hostname rather than IP address.

```bash
# Connect to VM
vagrant ssh [zeus|poseidon|hades]
```

## Tear Down and Clean Up

If you wish to completely wipe the environment and tear down the virtual machines, simply run:

```bash
# Destroys the Vagrant VMs and related drives
make clean
```

## Various TODOs

In no particular order and not an exclusive list, just jotting things down here.

* Implement Ansible for Nomad and Consul setup
* Create VM to serve as secondary server host in cluster
* Transfer central control from host machine to VM

## üîé About <a name = "about"></a>

A simple playground for software infrastructure tools and virtual machines. In this setup, the host machine will be the central device, networking with 3 virtual machines. Currently, this project is being developed on Linux, but should work on MacOS. Eventually, I plan to implement Ansible for VM setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The following must be installed on the host machine:

- [Python 3.8](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or greater
- [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)

It is highly recommended to use `pyenv` to manage Python versions. Everything else should be installed through the `Makefile` in a local scope only. The use of `direnv` allows for ease of access by allowing us to load and unload environment variables depending on the current directory.

## üöÄ Usage <a name="usage"></a>

In order to start up the Olympus Network machines, you can use the following command. Aside from enacting the standard `vagrant up`, this command first validates the Vagrantfile configuration before running.

```bash
# Start the Vagrant machines
make startup
```

If you want to use Ansible, we can configure a virtual environment to isolate the installation to local scope.

```bash
# Set up a Python3 virtual env, name it ".venv" for compatibility with the Makefile
python -m venv .venv

# Install Python prerequisites using local pip
make install-requirements
```

To remote connect into any of the virtual machines, we can use Vagrant's built-in ssh command. This allows us to connect via hostname rather than IP address.

```bash
# Connect to VM
vagrant ssh [zeus|poseidon|hades]
```

If you wish to completely wipe the environment and tear down the virtual machines, simply run:

```bash
# Destroys the Vagrant VMs and related drives
make clean
```
